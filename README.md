## Introduction

Meetily is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. It captures your meetings, transcribes them in real-time, and generates summaries, all without sending any data to the cloud. This makes it the perfect solution for professionals and enterprises who need to maintain complete control over their sensitive information.

## Why Meetily?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:

- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device.
- **Cost-Effective:** Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs.
- **Flexible:** Works offline and supports multiple meeting platforms.
- **Customizable:** Self-host and modify for your specific needs.

<details>
<summary>The Privacy Problem</summary>

Meeting AI tools create significant privacy and compliance risks across all sectors:

- **$4.4M average cost per data breach** (IBM 2024)
- **€5.88 billion in GDPR fines** issued by 2025
- **400+ unlawful recording cases** filed in California this year

Whether you're a defense consultant, enterprise executive, legal professional, or healthcare provider, your sensitive discussions shouldn't live on servers you don't control. Cloud meeting tools promise convenience but deliver privacy nightmares with unclear data storage practices and potential unauthorized access.

**Meetily solves this:** Complete data sovereignty on your infrastructure, zero vendor lock-in, and full control over your sensitive conversations.

</details>

## Features

- **Local First:** All processing is done on your machine. No data ever leaves your computer.
- **Real-time Transcription:** Get a live transcript of your meeting as it happens.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generate summaries of your meetings using powerful language models.
- **Multi-Platform:** Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Speaker Diarization (opt-in):** Separate a meeting's transcript into speaker turns after recording, once you've granted consent to download the local diarization models (see [Speaker Diarization](#speaker-diarization) below).
- **Open Source:** Meetily is open source and free to use.
- **Flexible AI Provider Support:** Choose from Ollama (local), Claude, Groq, OpenRouter, or use your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

</p>

### 🗣️ Speaker Diarization

Separate a finished meeting's transcript into speaker turns, entirely on your own CPU. It's
opt-in and off by default:

- **Consent prompt**: the first time you enable it (Settings > Preferences), Meetily tells
  you approximately how much it needs to download (~32 MB of open-source models) before
  anything is fetched. Declining leaves recording, transcription, and summarization exactly
  as they were — nothing is downloaded.
- **After that**, a finished meeting is automatically passed through speaker detection when
  you land on it straight from recording. You can also run it on demand from the transcript
  panel's Speakers button, and turn the automatic pass off separately (leaving diarization
  available on demand) or disable the feature entirely from Settings > Preferences at any
  time — both revoke cleanly with no re-prompting until you turn it back on.
- **Renaming speakers**: once a pass finishes, rename each detected speaker (e.g. "Speaker
  1" → "Alex") from the transcript panel. Names are scoped to that meeting.
- **Re-running discards names**: running speaker detection again for the same meeting
  (e.g. after correcting the transcript) replaces the previous run's speakers and any names
  you gave them — the UI warns about this before a re-run starts.

### ⚡ GPU Acceleration

Built-in support for hardware acceleration across platforms:

- **macOS**: Apple Silicon (Metal) + CoreML
- **Windows/Linux**: NVIDIA (CUDA), AMD/Intel (Vulkan)

Automatically enabled at build time - no configuration needed.

## System Architecture

Meetily is a single, self-contained application built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It uses a Rust-based backend to handle all the core logic, and a Next.js frontend for the user interface.

For more details, see the [Architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## For Developers

If you want to contribute to Meetily or build it from source, you'll need to have Rust and Node.js installed. For detailed build instructions, please see the [Building from Source guide](docs/BUILDING.md).

## Meetily Pro
